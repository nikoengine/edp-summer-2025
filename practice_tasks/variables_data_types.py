# How to create and use variables in python?
# For a better explanation you can visit the w3school which I'm using as resource
#https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_variables.asp


##First of all variables are nothing without values so we need at assing a value to our variable

Sensor1 = 'humidity'
Sensor2 = 'motion'
Sensor3 = 'temperature'

#Since I'm trying too build a zoo sensor system my variables will be related to that.
#Now we created values for our variables and when we print them--
print(Sensor1)
print(Sensor2)
print(Sensor3)

#We are seeing their values.
