#So what is a string?
#A string is just text. Anything between quotes (' ' or " ") is considered a string.

#You can do a lot with strings. Let me show you some cool string methods Python gives us.

animal = 'Elephant' #Here we create another variable and it's an animal for our zoo.

print(animal.upper())   # makes all letters uppercase
print(animal.lower())   # makes all letters lowercase
print(animal.startswith("E"))  # checks if the string starts with 'E'
print(len(animal))  # gives us the length of the string
