#Well we all forgot to great our employees to their new job.
#Lets do that. Meanwhile we are going to learn another feature of python.
#Well there are many ways in python for using loops. We can either use dictionaires or lists.
#But we need to use square brackets both of them.
#First we are going to great our animals because we create them with lists.
animals = ["elephant","tiger","lion","monkey"]

for animal in animals:
    print(f"Hello {animal}")

#So you might get confused but don't worry.
#We wrote animal because we wanted to use this instead of animals.
#You see its something you need to do when you use loops.Something is need to represent your variable, list and dictionary.
#It can be anything most of the coders use "i" or "x" but its doesnt really matter.
